# ANN-for-a-regression-problem
In this project, I examined a regression problem by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TENSORFLOW 2.3.1. The dataset which was applied in my previous project called "Regression (https://github.com/m1997f/Regression)" is used in this study too, that contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years and we want to try to predict an energy output without understanding how it works or science behind the energy. For predicting it we have 4 features which are: 1- AT : ambient Temperature in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C, 2- V : Exhaust Vacuum in the range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg, 3- AP : Ambient Pressure in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar, 4- RH : Relative Humidity in the range 25.56% to 100.16%.
